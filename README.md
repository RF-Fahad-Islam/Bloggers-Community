üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started
-------------------

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

-   [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/ "null") (3.8 or higher) & pip

-   [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/ "null")

-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads "null")

-   A code editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/ "null")

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/RF-Fahad-Islam/Bloggers-Community.git
    cd Bloggers-Community

    ```

2.  **Setup the Backend (Flask Server):**

    -   Navigate to the `server` directory.

        ```
        cd server

        ```

    -   Create and activate a virtual environment:

        ```
        # For macOS/Linux
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate

        # For Windows
        python -m venv venv
        .\venv\Scripts\activate

        ```

    -   Install the required Python packages:

        ```
        pip install -r requirements.txt

        ```

    -   Set up your PostgreSQL database and create a `.env` file in the `/server` folder with your credentials:

        ```
        # Example for PostgreSQL
        DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE_NAME"

        # Secret key for sessions and forms
        SECRET_KEY="your_super_secret_key_here"

        # Google OAuth Credentials
        GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your_google_client_id"
        GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your_google_client_secret"

        ```

    -   Initialize and upgrade the database with Flask-Migrate:

        ```
        flask db init  # Only run this the very first time
        flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"
        flask db upgrade

        ```

3.  **Frontend Setup:**

    -   The frontend consists of static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. **No installation is required.**

4.  **Run the Application:**

    -   **Start the Backend Server:** From the `/server` directory (with the virtual environment activated), run:

        ```
        flask run

        ```

        The server will start on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

    -   **Access the Frontend:** Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. The Flask application will serve the HTML pages directly.
